#### Notes on running:  
In order for the app to work we currently recommend testing the application using a larger screen or high pixel density. The emulated Pixel 4a or the Pixel 3a are recommended. This is due to an issue with having large values in a constraint layout. In addition to this, the level selector using the directional buttons is not implemeted at this time, but level transitions are available through mouse clicks on golden stars on the main puzzle screen, the botton left star is a placeholder that leads to a collections screen.

### Introduction  
Puzzle Bites is an android based puzzle game were users use directional buttons to move pieces around a 9x9 board and try to fill in all of the goal locations in the fewest number of moves. There are also a few mechanics tied to this: multiple pieces can move at once, pieces can be activated by pressing switches, and different pieces have different speeds to which they move.
