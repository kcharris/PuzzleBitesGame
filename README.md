# PuzzleBitesGame
#### Notes on running:  
In order for the app to work we currently recommend testing the application using a larger screen or high pixel density. Android Studio with the built in emulator running a Pixel 4a or the Pixel 3a is recommended. The target sdk is 33, and the minSDK is 24.  
The level selector currently works but is not labeled with words and leads to "puzzle1" for most options. The star on the bottom right leads to a trophy page. The settings page lists items that have yet to be implemented, ChangeBackground does work though.

### Introduction  
Puzzle Bites is an android based puzzle game were users use directional buttons to move pieces around a 9x9 board and try to fill in all of the goal locations in the fewest number of moves. There are also a few mechanics tied to this: multiple pieces can move at once, pieces can be activated by pressing switches, and different pieces have different speeds to which they move.
