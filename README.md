#### Notes on running:  
In order for the app to work we currently recommend testing the application using a larger screen or high pixel density. The emulated Pixel 4a or the Pixel 3a are recommended. This is due to an issue with having large values in a constraint layout.

### Introduction  
Puzzle Bites is an android based puzzle game were users use directional buttons to move pieces around a 9x9 board and try to fill in all of the goal locations in the fewest number of moves. There are also a few mechanics tied to this: multiple pieces can move at once, pieces can be activated by pressing switches, and different pieces have different speeds to which they move.
